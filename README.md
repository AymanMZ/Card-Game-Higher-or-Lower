# Card-Game-Higher-or-Lower
Part of the RPG Card Game MVPs, MVP #3. Adds a board and a game class, and makes a mini-game of guessing if the next number is greater or less than the previous one.

## Demonstration

The rules are simple, make a guess based on the current number if the next one will be higher or lower. <br> <br>

If the number is higher, your streak goes up. Else it goes back to 0. <br> <br>

Once per game, you can take the most recent card off the board, and make a guess based on the previous new card. <br> <br>

After the game is done, you will get a score based on your correct streak. <br> <br>
